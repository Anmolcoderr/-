Mediocre at Best ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê<br>
<i>The Qayamat is an okay option for dining. The "Mystical Mushroom Risotto" was a bit bland, and the presentation was underwhelming. The staff seemed a bit disorganized, leading to a less-than-perfect experience. There's potential, but some aspects need attention.</i>
